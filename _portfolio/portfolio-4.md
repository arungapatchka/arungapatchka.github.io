On Tuesday, February 11, 2025, CDHIâ€™s Visiting Scholar in Residence, Dr. Emily Christina Murphy, will lead a conversation around the topic of Digital Storytelling and its use in teaching within and beyond the university. Sharing reflections from her forthcoming volume EnTwine: A Critical and Creative Companion to Teaching with Twine, co-edited with Dr. Lai-Tze Fan, this conversation will delve into the ways the digital storytelling platform can support inclusive and creative teaching and scholarship. Dr. Murphy will be in conversation with Arun Jacob (PhD Candidate, Faculty of Information), who has contributed a chapter to the volume focused on international decolonial teaching with Twine.
